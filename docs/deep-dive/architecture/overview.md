Welcome to the Webiny Architecture Overview. This section will provide you with a visual overview of the Webiny architecture and as well explain the basic flows and components involved. 

This section is structured in 5 main articles:
- [API](/docs/deep-dive/architecture/api) - Talks about the API architecture, Apollo Gateway, and the built-in services.
- [Security Service](/docs/deep-dive/architecture/security-service) - Although security is part of the [API](/docs/deep-dive/architecture/api), this architecture focuses on the user authentication flow.
- [Client Side](/docs/deep-dive/architecture/client-side) - Overview of the architecture that's needed for serving client-side apps.
- [File Service](/docs/deep-dive/architecture/file-service) - File Service is a rather complex part of Webiny so we decided to make a dedicated page to provide a better overview of this service.
- [Resources](/docs/deep-dive/architecture/resources) - Overview of the resources that get created and deployed.
