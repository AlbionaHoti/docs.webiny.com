Form Builder is included by default in the initial Webiny installation,
so no additional installation steps are required. Just log in into 
the Webiny Admin, and in the left sidebar, choose Form Builder.

Here you will see a list of all previously created forms. And by 
selecting a form from the list, you can view its stats, form 
submissions, edit the form if you need to, and more.

Let's start by creating a brand new form by clicking on the "plus"
icon in the bottom right corner. You will be prompted to enter a form name.

Once you do that, you will be redirected to the form builder, from where
you can start creating your new form.

There are a couple of important UI sections in the form builder. 

Obviously, every form consists of form fields, so in order to add them, 
you can drag and dropping fields from the left side bar to the
central section. Notice that there you can add a brand new field, or
you can just use one of the existing fields, like First name, Last name,
e-mail, phone number, and similar.
