In this section we will cover everything you need to know in order to get started with the Form Builder app. 

Form Builder is included by default in every Webiny installation,
so no additional installation steps are required. Just log in into 
the Webiny Admin, and from the menu in the left sidebar, click on the Form Builder.

Once clicked, the first thing you'll see is the list of all previously created forms. 
As by default there aren't any, let's go ahead and create our first form. Click on the "plus"
icon in the bottom right corner. You will be prompted to enter a form name, after which you'll be automatically redirected to the form builder. 


There are a couple of important UI sections in the Form Builder:

Obviously, every form consists of form fields, so in order to add them, 
you can drag and dropping fields from the left side bar to the
central section. Notice that there you can add a brand new field, or
you can just use one of the existing fields, like First name, Last name,
e-mail, phone number, and similar.
