As mentioned in the [Getting Started](/docs/webiny-apps/form-builder/getting-started) section, Form Builder app is included by default in every Webiny installation. 

This also includes the [Page Builder](/docs/webiny-apps/page-builder/introduction) page element, which enables you to easily embed forms in any of your pages.  

You can do that by simple opening your page in the page builder, and selecting the form element from the elements menu on the left:   

![Form page element is located in the elements menu](/assets/webiny-apps/form-builder/embed-forms-via-page-builder/menu-form-element.png)

Once you drop it at the desired place in your page, you will be presented with the element settings dialog, which will enable you to select the form, and exact form revision.

You can either select a specific form revision, or just set it to always use the latest one. Notice that this only shows published revisions, which means you'll have to publish your form before embedding it into the page.
