Every form consists of fields, for example inputs, text areas, radio buttons, checkboxes and so on. You place these on a form in order to gather any type of information you might need for your particular case. You might want to ask your site visitors to enter their first and last name, e-mail address, phone number, job title, and similar.

Form builder lets you easily add any number of fields to your form. Once the form builder is opened, all of the available fields can be found in the left menu:

 Fields are organized into groups which can contain one or more predefined fields. For example, "Contact Information" field group contains frequently used fields used to gather your site visitor's personal information. This will speed up your form creation process because you won't have to create each field from scratch.

> You can [create your own custom field groups and fields](<(/docs/webiny-apps/form-builder/creating-new-form-fields)>) if you need to.

# Adding fields
To add a field to your form, simply drag and drop it to the form editor area, located in the center of the screen (note the placeholder with the _Drop your first field here_ message).

### Positioning fields
Form fields are placed into rows, in which you can place a maximum of four fields. To make it a bit easier, while you're dragging the fields, you will see green helper bars that will show you where the field can be dropped.
