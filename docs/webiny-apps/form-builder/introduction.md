Form Builder is a Webiny app that lets you create dynamic and rich forms 
with ease, with just a few clicks from a simple UI inside of the Webiny
Admin.

Once you create your first form, you can easily show it on your web site
using a simple React component or even better, embed it any way you 
like into your pages built with [Webiny Page Builder]().

Finally, you can also review all of received form submissions, 
check out conversion rates, create CSV exports, and more.
