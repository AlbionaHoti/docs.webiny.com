Aliases go in hand with envs (environments), they define the GraphQL endpoint. Where the content and model will get served.

Aliases can link to one env and unlink to another env. This allows instant changes between different versions of your content.

An env alias allows you to access and transform the data of an env, which name is the target env, through a different static identifier.
