Did you set up your Webiny account? If yes, make sure you have `Headless cms` enabled, if not then follow the [quick start](get-started/quick-start.md).

Webiny features a menu component that is extended via the content models from the Headless CMS.
This allows you to build great backend experience for your team, making it easy and intuitive for them to find exactly the content they are looking for.

You can navigate to **Headless CMS > Content Models Menu > [Models](/docs/webiny-apps/headless-cms/features/content-modeling) || [Groups](/docs/webiny-apps/headless-cms/features/content-modeling-groups)**

Model groups allow you to manage models in a group. That enables you to build logical sections for your content.
