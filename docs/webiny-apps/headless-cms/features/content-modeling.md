Did you set up your Webiny account? If yes, make sure you have `Headless cms` enabled, if not then follow the [quick start](get-started/quick-start.md).

To get hands-on the `Headless CMS` features, you can start by creating a content model.

**What is the content model?**

1st option:

> Content models are the place where you set up the structure, which will inform the way your content will assemble, reconfigure, and reuse.

2nd option:

> â€œA content model documents all the different  types of content you will have for a given project". Each content type will have a detailed definition and the relationships between. Rachel Lovinger writes in Content Modeling: A Master Skill.


3rd option:

> A content model is a formal representation of structured content. The content is a collection of content types and their inter-relationships. You can have different content model types as a summary for your end project.

You can navigate to **Headless CMS > Content Models > Models || Groups**. There you can create content models and model groups.

Model groups allow you to manage models in a group. That enables you to build logical sections for your content.

#### Creating content models

Webiny offers you powerful modeling features that allow you to model the content. You can define relationships using a simple drag&drop editor as  seen in the image below:

Content Model Fields enable you to define the fundamental characteristics of information.

Start from the project requirements and arrange the content flow as you need based on the design and function.
