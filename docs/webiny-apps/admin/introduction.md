The Admin app is one of the core Webiny apps that lets you build powerful modules and apps that are only available to project administrators. It is also utilized by all official Webiny apps, like for example [Page Builder](http://localhost:3001/docs/webiny-apps/page-builder/getting-started), [Form Builder](http://localhost:3001/docs/webiny-apps/form-builder/introduction), and [I18N](http://localhost:3001/docs/webiny-apps/i18n/introduction).
