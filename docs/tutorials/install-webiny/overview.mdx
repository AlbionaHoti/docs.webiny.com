This tutorial covers installing Webiny to your AWS cloud account. At the end of the tutorial, you will have a Webiny instance running which you can access via a CloudFront URL.

## Prerequisites

The following things are mandatory before you can proceed with the installation:

**✅ Node.js >= 12.0.0**

- If you don't have Node.js installed, the easiest way to install it is by [downloading the official binary](https://nodejs.org/en/).

**✅ yarn < 2.0**

- Follow the [official instructions](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).
- Or you can just run `npm install yarn -g`

**✅ AWS user credentials**

- The credentials need to be stored inside `~/.aws/credentials` on UNIX platforms, or `C:\Users\USERNAME\.aws\credentials` on Windows.
- In case you don't have this setup, [follow this guide](/docs/how-to-guides/deployment/configure-aws-credentials).
