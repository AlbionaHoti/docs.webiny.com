:::tip WHAT YOUâ€™LL LEARN
- how to create a brand new Webiny project
- how to deploy it to your [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) account
:::

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, make sure you have the following:

#### Node.js >= 12.0.0

- If you don't have Node.js installed, the easiest way to install it is by [downloading the official binary](https://nodejs.org/en/).

#### yarn < 2.0

- Follow the [official instructions](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).
- Alternatively, run the `npm install yarn -g` command

#### AWS account and configured credentials

- With the mentioned software, you also must have a valid AWS Account and user credentials set up on your system. Please [follow this guide](/docs/how-to-guides/deployment/configure-aws-credentials) if you need assistance in that regard.

## Project setup

Once you have all the prerequisites in place, we recommend creating a new Webiny project using `create-webiny-project` - a tool that sets everything up automatically for you. So, in your terminal of choice, run the following command:

```
npx create-webiny-project@beta my-new-project --tag beta
```

From there, follow the on-screen setup instructions, which includes answering a couple of project-related questions, and doing your first deployment.

### Custom or the default VPC - what should you choose?

During the setup, one of the questions that shows up is should your new project be deployed in a custom [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/) or the default one. The answer to that question depends on your needs.

If you're deploying this for development purposes, or you're working on a project prototype, it's reasonable to use the default VPC deployment. This is because all of the cloud resources that are needed for this setup are [free-tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) eligible. And, having a bit less secure system probably doesn't impose a problem at this point in time.

On the other hand, if we're talking about production deployment, then deploying resources inside of a custom VPC is recommended. Although this does incur a cost, it significantly improves your project's security posture.

:::info Still not sure?
If you're still not sure what to choose, go for the no-VPC setup. If needed, you can still do the switch down the road.

:::tip Cloud Infrastructure
Learn what gets deployed into the cloud (your AWS account) and how it all works in the [Cloud Infrastructure](/docs/key-topics/cloud-infrastructure/introduction) key topics section.
:::

## First deployment

Once your new project has been created, it's time to deploy it to your AWS account.

To do that, in your terminal, navigate to your project folder, and run the following command:

```
yarn webiny deploy
```

This builds all the code and deploys it to your AWS account, along with the necessary cloud infrastructure resources.

Note that the first deployment can take up to 20 minutes! So, even though it might look nothing is happening in the terminal, please be patient and let the process finish. If something went wrong, an error will be shown.

:::info What is deployed into my AWS account?

Finally, once the deployment has been done, you are presented with the URL over which you can access your Admin Area, and finish the installation.

:::tip Misplaced Admin area URL?
Running the `yarn webiny info` command in your Webiny project folder will give you all of the relevant project URLs.

## Troubleshooting

#### The AWS Access Key Id needs a subscription for the service

In some cases, upon deploying a new Webiny project, it's possible for users to experience the following error being thrown in their terminal:

```
SubscriptionRequiredException: The AWS Access Key Id needs a subscription for the service
```

This error can happen if an AWS account was just created. If that's the case, then there needs to pass some time until the account is fully activated on the AWS side. So, the only thing that can be done at this point is simply waiting and trying again later.

#### Newer Apple M1 devices

If you're using a next-generation Apple M1 device, there is a chance you might run into problems while deploying your new Webiny project. For example:

```
 +  pulumi:pulumi:Stack api-dev creating assertion failed [inst.has_value()]: failed to decode instruction: 0x0
```

This is probably due to the fact that the underlying software simply isn't ready yet for the new M1-based OS you're running. Based on [this](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27350) article, we've seen that doing the following export does resolve the shown issue in some cases:

```
export GODEBUG=asyncpreemptoff=1
```

Please try executing the command in your terminal, and run the deployment again. If this does not help, feel free to [ask](https://www.webiny.com/slack) for additional help.

#### Pulumi is throwing a `syscall.loadsystemlibrary` exception
There could be various reasons why this error was thrown. But, if deploying from a Windows machine, we've seen that it could be
caused by an anti-virus software that you might have installed on your machine. Our suggestion is to try to temporary disable it and see if that produces any positive outcome.
