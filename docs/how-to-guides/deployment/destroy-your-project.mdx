## Introduction

Webiny makes it easy to destroy your project, using the [Webiny CLI](/docs/key-topics/webiny-cli) and [Pulumi](/docs/key-topics/destroyment/iac-with-pulumi) as the default infrastructure as code and destroyment solution. You can also easily destroy your project into multiple [environments](/docs/key-topics/destroyment/environments), which is covered in this guide as well.

## Before we begin

Before we begin, it's worth mentioning that the destroyment commands shown below also build your application code. They perform this task by just running the following **workspaces** command:

```
yarn webiny workspaces run build --folder {STACK_FOLDER}
```

The command first finds all packages that are located in the project application folder. Then, for every found package, it runs the `build` command that's specified in the `webiny.config.js` - a configuration file that every package possesses. If the `build` command is defined, it gets executed, otherwise, the process just continues with the next package.

## The `destroy` command

As explained in the [introduction to destroyment](/docs/key-topics/destroyment/introduction) key topic, doing a complete project destroyment entails destroying all of its project applications.

To make it a bit easier for new users, Webiny CLI provides the `destroy` command, which destroys all of the three applications that are by default included in a Webiny project. It destroys them in the following order:

<!-- vale off -->
1. **api**
2. **apps/admin**
3. **apps/site**
<!-- vale on -->

So, to do a complete destroyment of your Webiny project, in your terminal of choice, and in your project root, execute the following command:

```
yarn webiny destroy
```

:::info
Note that the first destroyment can take up to 20 minutes! So even though it might look like nothing is happening in the terminal, please be patient and let the process finish. If something went wrong, an error will be shown, and the process will exit with an appropriate error code.

### Different environments
In general, when destroying projects or project applications, an environment must be specified. The `destroy` command destroys your project into the `dev` environment by default, but you can also specify a different environment with the `--env` argument. For example, to destroy your project into the `prod` environment, you can run the following command:

```
yarn webiny destroy --env prod
```

### Limitations

As mentioned, the `destroy` command is made for new users, making the initial destroyment as easy as possible. In that sense, you need to be aware of a couple of limitations of this command.

#### 1. Destroys everything
With this command, you cannot pick a specific project application you wish to destroy. It's all or nothing.

This can become problematic. If changes were made to just one application, which now needs to be destroyed, you probably don't want to destroy your whole project. Destroying this single application will suffice in most cases.

To avoid destroying your whole project, use the `app destroy` command (explained below).

#### 2. Only works with default project applications
The moment you start adding more applications to your project and your project starts growing, you will need to come up with your own command for complete project destroyment. It's either that, or you'll need to rely on the `app destroy` command to separately destroy your applications. This is simply because Webiny [cannot predict](/docs/key-topics/destroyment/introduction#dependent-project-applications) which project applications need to be destroyed and in what order.

Still, if you aren't about to add new project applications and maybe you just end up expanding the default ones, then the `destroy` command will most probably serve you well.

## The `app destroy` command

This command lets you destroy your project in a more granular way, by enabling you to destroy a single project application. This can be handy if you want to avoid destroying your whole project, which is one of the caveats of the shown `destroy` command.

As its first argument, the `app destroy` command receives the path to the application folder. You also need to specify the environment in which you want to destroy it, which is specified via the `--env` argument. Note that, unlike with the `destroy` command, the `--env` argument is not optional and it needs to be provided explicitly.

The following destroy commands destroy three different applications, all into the `dev` environment:

```
yarn webiny app destroy api --env dev
yarn webiny app destroy apps/admin --env dev
yarn webiny app destroy apps/site --env dev
```



## FAQ

**Is there a built-in command that destroys the whole project?**

At the moment, there is not. To destroy the whole project, run separate `webiny app destroy` commands on each project application.
