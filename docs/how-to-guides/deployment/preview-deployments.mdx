- how to preview cloud infrastructure deployment for your project application
:::

## Introduction

During the project development, there is a chance that the deployed cloud infrastructure needs to change. New resources might be added, existing resources configured differently, and some may even need to be destroyed.

When doing more significant changes like reconfiguring and destroying cloud infrastructure resources, it might be helpful to preview the deployment process that you're about to execute. More specifically, you would certainly like to know if the deployment you're about to execute will destroy any of the mission-critical resources, e.g. a database or file storage resource.

## The Preview Flag

In order to avoid performing unintended cloud infrastructure changes, you can use the preview flag when executing the [deploy](/docs/how-to-guides/deployment/deploy-your-project) command.

## FAQ
**Does the preview flag work with the [`deploy`](/docs/how-to-guides/deployment/deploy-your-project#the-deploy-command) and [`destroy`](/docs/how-to-guides/deployment/destroy-your-project#the-destroy-command) command?**

The preview flag only works with the `app deploy` and `app destroy` commands, shown in this guide.
