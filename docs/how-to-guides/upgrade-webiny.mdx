## How to upgrade

:::caution
The following guide does not apply if you're interested in doing a major version upgrade, for example upgrading from version 4 to version 5.
:::

Upgrading Webiny consists of two parts.

The first part is to upgrade all of the `@webiny/*` packages to the latest version.

Since every Webiny project is using [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/upgrade/) as the package manager, to upgrade all `@webiny/*` packages, you can use the [`yarn upgrade`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/upgrade/) command, like so:

```
yarn upgrade --scope @webiny
```

:::info
The `yarn upgrade` command updates your `yarn.lock` file. Learn more about it in the [official documentation](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/yarn-lock/).
:::

<!-- vale off -->
Once that's done, the second part is to check our **Release notes & upgrading** section, and see if there are any additional notes and steps that need to be taken in order to complete the upgrade process. The additional steps part is definitely something we want to avoid having, but sometimes it might be necessary.

:::info
At the moment, the mentioned **Release notes & upgrading** section is empty, but as soon Webiny leaves the `beta` phase, new pages will start appearing there too.

:::caution
Note that if you didn't upgrade Webiny for some time, multiple new versions might've been released in the meantime. Double check the **Release notes & upgrading** section when doing larger upgrades.

## Troubleshooting

**The shown `yarn upgrade --scope @webiny` command doesn't work.**

If the shown command doesn't work, the next step is to try running `yarn upgrade`. We've seen that helps, but ultimately, if that doesn't help either, you can also try upgrading using [`upgrade-interactive`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/upgrade-interactive), like so:

```
yarn upgrade-interactive
```

## FAQ

**Once upgraded, do we need to re-deploy the Webiny project in order to see the changes?**

Yes, once you've completed the upgrade steps, in order to actually see the new features and fixes online, you need to re-deploy you project. Which project applications you need to re-deploy? It depends on the released fixes and features, but the easiest approach would be just to deploy the entire project, using the [`yarn webiny deploy`](/docs/how-to-guides/deployment/deploy-your-project#the-deploy-command) command.

Additionally, before you re-deploy the changes into the production environment, it's recommended that you re-deploy the changes into one of your test or preview environments first.

**Is it possible to upgrade Webiny from v4 to v5?**

Differences between these two versions are so vast that it's simply impossible to do the upgrade. If you're interested in migrating your existing project to v5, unfortunately, you will have to recreate your existing content in a new v5 project, either manually, or by writing your own custom migration scripts.

**How can we check what's the version of Webiny we're currently at?**

In your terminal of choice and in your project root, run the following command:

```
yarn webiny --version
```

Additionally, the version is also shown in the deployed Admin Area React application, at the bottom of the main menu:
