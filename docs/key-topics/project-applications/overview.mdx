This key topic covers project applications, which are an important part of every Webiny project. In the end, you learn how project applications are structured.

## The basics

Webiny uses the term **project application** (or just **application**) in order to depict a specific logical segment of your project. Every application, essentially, consists of two pieces:

1. Your application code, which includes one or more Node.js packages. These packages can be anything from a simple GraphQL API or a single Lambda function, to a complete React application.
2. Cloud infrastructure that hosts your code or which is being utilized by it, which is also described and deployed using code. For that matter, by default, Webiny relies on a solution called [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/), which is modern infrastructure as code solution (more on this in the following sections).

Moving on, every application has its own folder. For example, in a newly created Webiny project, by default, you end up with three applications. The **API** (`./api`), which represents your project's (GraphQL) API, **Admin Area** (`./apps/admin`), and finally, the **Public Website**  (`./apps/site`), which is your public website. These applications are shown in the following directory tree:

```
.
├── api
│   ├── pulumi
│   ├── Pulumi.yaml
│   ├── Pulumi.dev.yaml
│   ├── code
│   └── index.ts
├── apps
│   ├── admin
│   │   ├── pulumi
│   │   ├── Pulumi.yaml
│   │   ├── Pulumi.dev.yaml
│   │   ├── code
│   │   └── index.ts
│   └── site
│       ├── pulumi
│       ├── Pulumi.dev.yaml
│       ├── Pulumi.yaml
│       ├── code
│       └── index.ts
└── (...)
```

## A closer look
If we take a look at the directory tree above, we can notice a consistent files and folders structure.

As mentioned, every application consists of your code and cloud infrastructure (also described via code).

The `code` folder is where all of the application's code is located. In case of the API (`./api/code`), it contains several packages that form the GraphQL API. In case of Admin Area (`./apps/admin/code`) and Public Website (`./apps/site/code`), it contains React applications.

On the other hand, the `pulumi` folder and the `Pulumi.yaml`, `Pulumi.dev.yaml`, and `index.ts` files contain Pulumi code that define your cloud infrastructure. Again, in case of the API application, these define several cloud infrastructure resources like Lambda functions, an API Gateway, a DynamoDB table, and so on. The Admin Area and Public Website applications contain fewer cloud resources, as they serve a bit simple (but still important) purpose.

## FAQ
**How many applications can a single Webiny project have?**

Each Webiny project can have any number of applications. This depends on the project requirements that are in front of you.

**Can applications work together?**

Yes, and in most cases, they are.
