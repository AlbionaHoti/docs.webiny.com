## Description

The diagram shows what happens every time a GraphQL query or mutation (an HTTP request) gets issued by the client, for example, the **Admin Area**, or **Website** applications.

The steps are the following:

1. The GraphQL HTTP request first reaches the Amazon CloudFront <diagram-letter>A</diagram-letter>.
2. The request is forwarded to the Amazon API Gateway <diagram-letter>B</diagram-letter>.
3. The Amazon API Gateway invokes the GraphQL Server Lambda function <diagram-letter>C</diagram-letter>.
4. Depending on the issued GraphQL operation, the Lambda function's code may issue one or more requests to other cloud infrastructure resources:
    1. Amazon Cognito <diagram-letter>D</diagram-letter> to perform identity authentication
    2. Amazon DynamoDB <diagram-letter>E</diagram-letter> or Amazon ElasticSearch Service <diagram-letter>F</diagram-letter> to perform database queries
5. Once the code execution has completed, an HTTP response is returned back to the Amazon API Gateway <diagram-letter>B</diagram-letter>, and again forwarded to the Amazon CloudFront <diagram-letter>A</diagram-letter>, and finally returned back to the client.
