## Overview

By default, a Webiny project contains three [project applications](/docs/key-topics/project-applications):

<!-- vale off -->

1. **api** (`./api`) - your project's GraphQL API
2. **admin** (`./apps/admin`) - admin area
3. **website** (`./apps/website`) - public website
   <!-- vale on -->

In order for these applications to actually work, a set of cloud infrastructure resources needs to be deployed into the cloud (your AWS account).

If we wanted to compare these applications by the complexity of needed cloud infrastructure, we could say that **api** is the most complex one. This is simply because it requires the biggest number of different cloud infrastructure resources in order for it to work. On the other hand, the **admin** and **website** project applications basically just represent React applications, and to host these, we only need a couple of different cloud infrastructure resources.

In the following sections, we are examining what cloud infrastructure resources get deployed for each application, how they are working together, different configurations, the overall cost, and so on.
