### Monorepo organization

Every Webiny project is structured as a [monorepo](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/monorepos), using [yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/).

This benefits us in a couple of ways. Most importantly, it makes sure downloaded packages are stored in a most efficient way. It also makes it possible to organize different logical sections of your project as multiple packages, and easily import them from any other package (application).

:::info
Webiny CLI provides the `webiny workspaces` command, which makes it a bit easier to perform commands across multiple workspaces. Be sure to check the [CLI Reference](#) or run `webiny workspaces --help` in your terminal for more information.

## FAQ

**Can we use a different package manager, like yarn2 or NPM?**

At the moment, Webiny projects are set up to work with [yarn 1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/), exclusively. This is simply because it and its `workspaces` functionality is still a solid solution.
We've looked into [yarn 2](https://yarnpkg.com/), and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6), but found these not to be as stable, and proven as we'd like them to be. We are definitely all-in when it comes to simplifying the development toolchain, but at this moment, that is simply not possible.
