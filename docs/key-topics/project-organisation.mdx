:::tip What you’ll learn
- what are the fundamental organisational units of every Webiny project and their most important characteristics
:::


## Overview

Every Webiny project consists of two fundamental organisation units - **packages** and **project applications** (or just **applications**).

Packages are just regular [NPM packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-packages-and-modules#about-packages), or in other words, folders with its own `package.json` declaration file and some code.
On the other hand, project applications are higher-level organisational units formed from one or more packages that, as the name itself suggest, form applications. Applications consist of both application code and cloud infrastructure that is needed in order to run them.

Visit the [Project Applications](/docs/key-topics/project-applications/overview) section to learn more about applications - what they consist of, what tools we use, how they are deployed, and more.

The following diagram shows the project organisation in a simplified and clear manner:

<img
  src={require("./assets/project-organisation/organisation.png").default}
  className="no-shadow"
  style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}

/>

If we were to translate the above diagram into a directory tree, we would end up with the following:

```
.
├── Project Application 1
│   └── code
│       ├── package-1a
│       ├── package-1b
│       └── package-1c
│  
├── Project Application 2
│   └── code
│       ├── package-2a
│       └── package-2b
│  
├── packages
│   ├── shared-package-1
│   └── shared-package-2
└── (...)
```

Packages **1a**, **1b**, and **1c** are located in the `Project Application 1/code` folder, and the **2a** and **2b** in `Project Application 2/code`. As seen in the diagram above, these projects are also using shared packages `shared-package-1` and `shared-package-2`, and these are located in a separate `packages` folder.

## Important Characteristics
Here are some of the most important characteristics of packages and applications.

#### Package scope

A package can represent literally anything. From a simple JavaScript function, or a class, one, or more plugins, a whole REST/GraphQL API, or even a full-blown React app. You can even create utility packages that, for example, export one, or more utilities, and are imported by other packages (applications) in your project.

#### Limits

There is no limit in terms of the total number of packages and applications a single Webiny project can have.

#### Package and project application dependencies

Packages and applications can be independent, but, more importantly, can also be dependent on other packages, and applications, respectively.

In terms of packages, an example might be a utility (shared) package whose code is imported by other packages. This way you keep your code in a single location and don't repeat yourself, which effectively makes the code easier to maintain.

The same can happen with project applications. For example, let's say you have a simple HTTP API and a React app that's relying on it. In this case, the project application that's holding the React app depends on the project application that's holding the HTTP API.

## Monorepo organisation

Every Webiny project is structured as a [monorepo](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/monorepos), using [yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/).

This benefits us in a couple of ways. Most importantly, it makes sure downloaded packages are stored in a most efficient way. It also makes it possible to organize different logical sections of your project as multiple packages, and easily import them from any other package (application).

:::info
Webiny CLI provides the `webiny workspaces` command, which makes it a bit easier to perform commands across multiple workspaces. Be sure to check the [CLI Reference](#) or run `webiny workspaces --help` in your terminal for more information.

## FAQ

**Can we use a different package manager, like yarn2 or NPM?**

At the moment, Webiny projects are set up to work with [yarn 1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/), exclusively. This is simply because it and its `workspaces` functionality is still a solid solution.
We've looked into [yarn 2](https://yarnpkg.com/), and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6), but found these not to be as stable, and proven as we'd like them to be. We are definitely all-in when it comes to simplifying the development toolchain, but at this moment, that is simply not possible.
