This key topic covers key organisational units of every Webiny project.

## Monorepo organisation

Every Webiny project is organized as a [monorepo](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/monorepos), which means the project consists of multiple packages (also known as workspaces). A package can serve a different purpose. For example, a package can represent a GraphQL API, a single Lambda function, or even a whole React app. You can even create utility packages that are used by multiple other packages in your project.

Monorepo organisation is established using [yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/).

:::info Webiny CLI
Webiny CLI provides the `webiny workspaces` command, which makes it a bit easier to perform commands across multiple workspaces. Be sure to check the [CLI Reference](#) or run `webiny workspaces --help` in your terminal for more information.

## Stacks

With packages as the essential organisational units of every Webiny project, another unit are stacks.

Webiny uses the term "stack" in order to depict a specific segment of your project, which essentially consists of two elements:
1. your code, which includes one or more packages, and can be anything from a simple GraphQL API, to a complete React application
2. cloud infrastructure that supports your code or which is being utilized by it

For example, in a newly created project, by default you receive three stacks. The `api` stack which represents your project's API, `apps/admin` stack which is your Admin area, and finally, the `apps/site` stack, which is your public website.

Each of these three stacks are standalone units, and are built and deployed separately, using Webiny CLI.
