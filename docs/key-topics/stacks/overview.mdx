This key topic covers project stacks, which are an important part of every Webiny project. In the end, you learn how project stacks are structured, how you can update a stack, and ultimately, deploy it.

## The basics

Webiny uses the term **project stack** in order to depict a specific logical segment of your project, which essentially consists of two pieces:

1. Your code, which includes one or more Node.js packages, that can be anything from a simple GraphQL API, to a complete React application.
2. Cloud infrastructure that hosts your code or which is being utilized by it. It is also described using code, and by default, it is deployed using [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/), a modern infrastructure as code solution.

Every project stack has its own folder. For example, in a newly created Webiny project, by default, you end up with three stacks. The **API** (`./api`) stack, which represents your project's (GraphQL) API, **Admin Area** (`./apps/admin`) stack, and finally, the **Public Website**  (`./apps/site`) stack, which is your public website. These stacks are shown in the following directory tree:

```
.
├── api
│   ├── pulumi
│   ├── Pulumi.yaml
│   ├── Pulumi.dev.yaml
│   ├── code
│   └── index.ts
├── apps
│   ├── admin
│   │   ├── pulumi
│   │   ├── Pulumi.yaml
│   │   ├── Pulumi.dev.yaml
│   │   ├── code
│   │   └── index.ts
│   └── site
│       ├── pulumi
│       ├── Pulumi.dev.yaml
│       ├── Pulumi.yaml
│       ├── code
│       └── index.ts
│  
└── (...)
```

## A closer look
If we take a look at the directory tree above, we can notice a consistent files and folders structure.

As mentioned, every stack consists of your code and cloud infrastructure (also described via code).

The `code` folder is where all of the stack's code is located. In case of the API stack (`./api/code`), it contains several packages that form the GraphQL API. In case of Admin Area (`./apps/admin/code`) and Public Website (`./apps/site/code`), it contains React applications.

On the other hand, the `stack` folder and the `Pulumi.yaml`, `Pulumi.dev.yaml`, and `index.ts` files contain Pulumi code that define your infrastructure.

Again, in case of the API stack, these define several cloud infrastructure resources like Lambda functions, an API Gateway, a DynamoDB table, and so on. The Admin Area and Public Website stacks contain less resources, as they serve a bit simple (but still important) purpose.

## FAQ
**How many stacks can a single Webiny project have?**

Each Webiny project can have any number of stacks. This depends on the project requirements that are in front of you.
