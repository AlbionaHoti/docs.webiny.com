## Overview

Project deployment is an important part of an application development lifecycle.

Essentially, deploying your project entails deployment of necessary cloud infrastructure resources with the application code you wrote. It can be done from your machine directly, which is usually the case when developing, or from a remote environment, for example CI/CD systems, that, based on provided instructions, deploy your project automatically for you.

Whatever the case, Webiny makes it easy to both build and deploy your project, using the [Webiny CLI](/docs/key-topics/webiny-cli) and [Pulumi](/docs/key-topics/deployment/iac-with-pulumi) as the default infrastructure as code and deployment solution. Additionally, without any special configuration, you can also easily deploy your project into multiple [environments](/docs/key-topics/deployment/environments).

## Deploying project applications - not projects

As explained in the [project organisation](/docs/key-topics/project-organization) section, every Webiny project can consist of one or more project applications. Furthermore, every project application consists of [application code and the necessary infrastructure](/docs/key-topics/project-applications) that's needed in order to run it.

With that in mind, it's important to note that when talking about deployments, we're talking about **deploying project applications, not projects**. Meaning, if your project consisted of three project applications, in order to deploy the whole project, you would need to execute three separate Webiny CLI commands.

## Dependent project applications

As stated in the section above, fully deploying a Webiny project entails deploying all of its project applications.

Although it might sound simple enough, one thing we still have to take into consideration are dependent applications. In the [Project Organization](/docs/key-topics/project-organization#package-and-project-application-dependencies) key topic, it's shown that applications can be dependent on each other. For example, if we had two applications, where one represents an HTTP API, and the other a React application that relies on the API, that means the former needs to be deployed before the latter. We can't deploy a React application and expect it to work, if we don't know the URL of the API to which it needs to talk to.

So, as we can see, the order of deploying does matter, and this is the reason why, out of the box, Webiny does not provide any CLI commands for a complete project deployment. The order is something Webiny cannot predict and it's up to the developers to come up with a process for a complete project deployment, if need be.

That being said, to make it a bit easier for users that just started using Webiny, every new Webiny project does include a helper `yarn webiny deploy` command. This command deploys the three applications that are included in a Webiny project by default, in the following order:

1. **api**
2. **apps/admin**
3. **apps/site**

:::info
This `yarn webiny deploy` command will suffice in a lot of cases. But again, if you are adding more applications to your project and your project is growing, then overriding the existing `deploy` command for a complete project deployment can be a reasonable thing to do. [Check out the code](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5/packages/cwp-template-aws/cli/deploy/deploy.js) for the already existing command to get on the right track.

## FAQ
**What does Webiny use to deploy cloud infrastructure?**

Webiny uses Pulumi, a modern infrastructure as code solution. Find out more in the following [IaC with Pulumi](/docs/key-topics/deployment/iac-with-pulumi) key topic.

**Is there a built-in command that destroys the whole project?**

At the moment, there is not. To do that, run separate `webiny stack destroy` commands on each project application. Please visit the [Deploy your project](/docs/how-to-guides/deployment/deploy-your-project) guide to learn more.
