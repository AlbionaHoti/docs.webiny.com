**What Webiny is not, and what you can't use Webiny for:**

- Webiny is not a library that you can embed in other applications. Webiny is a standalone application. You can render Page Builder pages and Form Builder forms in 3rd party React apps. You can't embed the editors inside 3rd party apps.
- At the moment you can't run Webiny on a different cloud provider, besides AWS. It you wish to add support for another cloud provider, please see [this issue](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/issues/1150).
