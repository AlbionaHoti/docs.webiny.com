<Theme>

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ **Webiny** is a JavaScript serverless application framework with a built-in CMS. We created Webiny specifically to help developers architect, build and deploy solutions on top of serverless infrastructure, like AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, S3 and other.

We believe that serverless is the future of development, but having tried ourselves building a solution using only serverless services we saw this is a challenging task. There are many tools that help you deploy and monitor an app on top of the serverless infrastructure, but we found none that help you actually build one. 

You can read more about Webiny and our philosophy below, but in case you want to immediately give Webiny a try, just follow the installation tutorial.

## Our philosophy

We have three main goals:
- provide a solution where every aspect can be easily customized
- amazing experience for developers
- less abstraction and black boxes, more clarity



Webiny at its core doesn't do much. Over 90% of Webiny's code is actually inside plugins. From how the Webiny CLI deploys your build, to how the API checks the user permissions, to the Webiny logo in side the Admin panel. Those are all plugins. This approach allowed us to build a platform that is flexible in every meaning of the word. You can completely replace existing plugins, turn them on or off or expand on them, customizing Webiny to fully fit your needs. 

The great thing about Webiny's plugin system is that it's unified across the board, no matter if you're changing the CLI functionality, adding new GraphQL resolvers or a new button in the UI, the approach is always the same as well as the plugin interface. This makes it easy for anyone to pickup and understand how the whole system works, no matter frontend or backend.

Webiny believes on unified developer experience. From first installing your project to deploying it and seeing it live all that's needed are 2 commands. Webiny handles all the heavy lifting under the hood, but in a transparent way, not hiding anything and making it hard to understand. Less abstra






Coming from a background of first owning a web development agency and then spending years building enterprise projects we saw first hand how development is far from optimal. When serverless came to the scene, we were exatic, until we actually tried building something with it. 

## About Webiny

**What's included, and what you can do with Webiny:**

      <strong>With Webiny you can build:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Websites</li>
      <li>Applications</li>
      <li>GraphQL APIs</li>
      <li>Microservices</li>
    </ul>
  </Box>
</Grid>

**What Webiny is not, and what you can't use Webiny for:**

- Webiny is not a library that you can embed in other applications. Webiny is a standalone application. You can render Page Builder pages and Form Builder forms in 3rd party React apps. You can't embed the editors inside 3rd party apps.
- At the moment you can't run Webiny on a different cloud provider, besides AWS. It you wish to add support for another cloud provider, please see [this issue](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/issues/1150).
