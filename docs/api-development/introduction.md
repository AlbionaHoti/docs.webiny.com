When you create a new [Webiny project](/docs/get-started/quick-start), on the admin app's menu, you will find the `API Information,` which consists of the main `GraphQL` API, as seen in the image below.

This GraphQL API is the main URL, where we load the GraphQL playground.

In this URL, you will find several queries and mutations preinstalled with Webiny, as seen in the image below.

### API Development with Webiny

As noted in the [Commodo](/docs/api-development/commodo/introduction) section:

:::info Note
To simplify API development, Webiny heavily relies on a package called [Commodo](https://github.com/webiny/commodo).

What is Commodo?
Learn more about it [here](/docs/api-development/commodo/introduction).

Webiny is organizing Knowledge-Sharing sessions to create a knowledge database for our users.
